Lightweight CSS 

This is a very simple lightweight css helper that helps you avoid creating multiple custom classes for styles that are used way too often in Web Design.

## How to install
`npm install lightweight-css`

You can choose to import it straight 
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="./node_modules/lightweight-css/lightweight-css.css"/>`

or if you're using Webpack to compile and bundle your CSS you can simply use:
`import "lightweight-css";`

Hope this utility helps you!
